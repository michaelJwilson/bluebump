gen_bthru.py:     Generate new b-camera throughput curves.

New b-throughput: data/throughput/thru-b-dip.fits
New config:       desi.yaml


degrade_spec.py:  ivar -> thru * thru * ivar. i.e. replicate loss of signal/noise by
                  amplifying noise.

zeff.py:         Generate final report metrics and plots.

run_qspectra.py:  Run quickspectra with new b-throughput desi.yaml


NOTE:
Dynamic exposures were not used for this dipthru run, so large differences are seen with
e.g. original redwood run.
